            <h1>3 – Functions and arrays in PHP:</h1>


<h2>1. Can you modify the function addOne($number) to use the pre-increment? And the
    post increment? Does it work as expected? If not, what is happening?</h2>


If you do a pre-increment or a post-increment, both are applied in the function and once they are returned, they are incremented


<h2>2. Can you create a function to create lists in HTML? It should receive an array with the
    elements of the list, and an optional parameter to specify the type of list (ordered,
    unordered, description). It will return the string with the resulting HTML. It shouldn’t
    modify the arrays.</h2>

<h2>3. Can you create a function to create tables in HTML? It should receive a
    multidimensional array, with the data to fill the HTML table. It will return the string
    with the resulting HTML. It shouldn’t modify the array.</h2>

<h2>4. Functions can be recursive? If so, create a function that performs a deep count of the elements in a multidimensional array. (It has to count elements inside arrays also, have in mind that an array can contain an array that contains an array…)
</h2>

<h2>5. Modify the function to also calculate the deepest level (regular array is a level 1 array).</h2>



<h2>6. Combine both so you return an array with the two “descriptions” (totalCount,deepestLevel) and the two values.</h2>



<h2>7. Can you make the function from exercise 2 work also for nested lists of any depth?</h2>



<h2>8. ¿ Can you create a function that generates an array of random depth / size ? You need to bound the parameters somewhat or you will end up in an infinite loop! (HINT: the probability of generating a nested array should decrease at some point)</h2>



<h2>9. Can you create a function to build up arrays from two strings? The first string will
    include comma separated keys for the array. The second string will include comma
    separated values.</h2>



<h2>10. Can you create a function that traverses an array and modifies it: When finds a
    number turn it into a string, when find a string turns it into a number. (Test it with
    strings containing numbers and with random strings). It has to modify the array in
    place, not returning anything.</h2>
